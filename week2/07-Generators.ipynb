    "How this works may still be unclear - that's because it's iterating through the sequence lazily. This means instead of moving through a sequence all at once the generator will iterate and calculate the value only when it's asked to - waiting until the very last minute before it has to do any work. Hence the lazy term. This is more clearly demonstrated below."
